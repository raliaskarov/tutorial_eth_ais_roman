You already did a first try(s) that failed. You have some more information in the prompt about what went wrong.
Keep everything that worked! Specifically if there were any, keep the dataframe paths as they were if they worked"!
Still stick to the guidelines from before, just try to fix the error.
Here some hintes that might help:
If a csv file is not found try to get it via os.environ['CSV_PATH'].
If column name mismatch: consider renaming the columns at the end to the desired names. They need to match EXACTLY!
If ParserError: try `engine="python"`, set correct `sep`/`quotechar`, and skip bad lines.
If KeyError: print/inspect `df.columns`, strip spaces, align casing, or rename columns.
If dtype/ValueError: strip symbols like `$`, `â‚¬`, `%`, normalize decimal separators, then `astype(float)`.
If plot fails: return table only; plotting is optional.
